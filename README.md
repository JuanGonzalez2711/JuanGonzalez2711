- 👋 Hi, I’m @JuanGonzalez2711, Training Engineer in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the Sergio Arboleda University.
- 👀 I’m interested in Learn New Things, Enjoy Life, Travel the World, Play Soccer, Play Video Games and watch Formula 1.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Programming in Java, C ++ and Python Programming Languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Projects that until now are starting from anything and can teach me new things, to implement them in my life as an engineer and I can use them in the Future.
- Clarification: I am starting in the world of Programming, so I have very little experience.
